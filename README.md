This project is a multiplayer quiz application, developed using Java Swing for the
graphical user interface and Java Sockets for networking. The application enables a host
to create and manage quiz sessions, where multiple players can join via a shared IP
address and participate in real-time.
The system follows a client-server architecture. The server (host) is responsible for
creating quiz questions, broadcasting them to connected clients, and maintaining a
centralized scoreboard. Each client represents a player who answers questions through a
simple interface
